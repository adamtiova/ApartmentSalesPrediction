## Project Introduction

In the fast-paced real estate market of Daegu, setting the right price for an apartment can be a real challenge. Price it too high, and you might end up with an apartment that sits unsold for months. Price it too low, and you could be leaving money on the table. That’s where this project comes in.

Using data science and machine learning, I’ve developed a model that helps predict the best price to list an apartment. The dataset I worked with includes important details like the apartment’s size, how old it is, and how close it is to things like schools and subway stations. The goal was to create a tool that real estate professionals can use to set prices that are competitive yet still profitable.

To make sure the model’s predictions are on point, I used a metric called Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). This basically shows how close the model’s predictions are to actual market prices, so we know it’s giving realistic advice.

In the end, this project is all about helping sellers make smarter, data-driven decisions when pricing their apartments. Whether you’re a real estate agent or just curious about how data science can be applied in real-world scenarios, this project offers a glimpse into the power of predictive modeling.
